## Unicode & The Unicode Standard
Unicode(formally, the Unicode Standard) is a framework for encoding, representing, and managing text on digital systems.Maintained by the Unicode Consortium, Unicode currently defines nearly 150, 000 characters across a wide variety of scripts and symbols.Unicode assigns each character a code point, a unique number, but it‚Äôs essential to remember that Unicode itself is not an encoding; it‚Äôs a map of code points that encodings like UTF - 8, UTF - 16, and UTF - 32 then translate into bytes.

As of Unicode v15.0, the standard includes 161 scripts‚Äîsome used by only one language and others by multiple languages. Unicode supports current and historic scripts, including extinct languages.

## Clarification on Glyphs vs. Characters
It‚Äôs common to refer to characters as "glyphs," but technically a glyph is the visual representation of a character and can vary depending on the font.

## What is a Script?
In Unicode, a script is a set of characters and symbols used for writing one or more languages. For example:
- Basic Latin script spans code points U+0000 to U+007F and includes the English alphabet.
- Cyrillic script spans U+0400 to U+04FF and includes characters for Russian and related languages.

Some scripts, like Armenian, represent only one language, while others, like Latin, are used by multiple languages, including English, French, and Vietnamese.

## The Era Before Unicode
Before Unicode, text encoding was fragmented into various character encodings specific to languages or regions (e.g., ASCII, ISO 8859, and Windows-1252). These encoding standards often conflicted, resulting in garbled text when transferred across systems that used different encoding schemes.

For example:
- ASCII uses one 8-bit byte per character, but its code points cover only the basic Latin alphabet and control characters.
- Extended standards, like ISO 8859 and Windows-1252, add characters but remain limited by encoding space, often overlapping in ways that caused compatibility issues.

Unicode was created to unify these encoding standards into a single, comprehensive system to represent most of the world's languages.

## I/O, Bytes & Encodings
### Why There‚Äôs No Such Thing as "Plain Text"
When dealing with text as bytes, knowing the encoding used to generate those bytes is crucial. Text without encoding context is meaningless to a computer, as bytes are just binary data until interpreted by an encoding scheme.

This is especially true in I/O operations. When a text file is sent from computer A in Japan to computer B in the USA, we need the correct encoding to interpret the byte stream properly.

### How Encoding is Determined
Encoding is often specified by context:
- Over the internet, it‚Äôs specified in HTTP headers (e.g., "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8").
- In HTML or XML files, it appears in metadata (\<meta charset="UTF-8"\>).

When encoding isn‚Äôt specified, heuristics can help, but they are unreliable. Always specify encoding to avoid misinterpretation.

## How UTF-8 Works
UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding that represents Unicode code points in 1 to 4 bytes. It‚Äôs backward-compatible with ASCII, meaning ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text.

Example:
- The letter "A" (code point U+0041) in UTF-8 is encoded as a single byte (0x41).

UTF-8 is widely used on the web and is often the default encoding in systems, programming languages, and applications.

## Notes on Encoding Variants
- UTF-16 uses 2 or 4 bytes per character, which can be beneficial for languages with many non-ASCII characters but has disadvantages in storage efficiency.
- UTF-32 uses 4 bytes per character uniformly, offering simple processing but with significant storage costs.

In most applications, UTF-8 is the best choice due to its compatibility and efficiency.

## Why the Fuss About Unicode?
Why not just stick with ASCII? Well, ASCII only covers 128 characters‚Äîbarely enough for basic English. Unicode, however, aims to cover all text systems in a single, universal standard, eliminating the confusion and compatibility issues of past encoding schemes.

In the early 90s, the internet accelerated Unicode‚Äôs adoption as more text needed to be exchanged globally. Unicode incorporates characters from legacy encodings (e.g., Windows-1252) to ensure backward compatibility.

## Common Unicode Myths
1. **"Unicode is 16-bit and has 65,536 characters."**
Incorrect. Unicode is not limited to 16 bits. While early Unicode proposals suggested a 16-bit system, Unicode today spans over 1 million code points (0 to 0x10FFFF).

2. **"Unicode is an encoding."**
Also incorrect. Unicode is a standard, not an encoding. UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are encoding formats that define how to represent Unicode code points in bytes.

## Practical Advice for Working with Unicode
Handling Unicode effectively requires knowing:
- The level of representation you‚Äôre dealing with‚Äîcode points, bytes, or glyphs.
- Encoding consistency‚Äînever assume encoding, especially for data from unknown sources.

**Pro-tip**: Modern systems default to UTF-8, but misinterpretations can still occur, often with ISO-8859-1 (latin1) or cp1252 on legacy systems.

## Exploring Unicode in Python
Here's a Python example to illustrate basic Unicode encoding and decoding.
(soao)[/graphics/blog/10-minutes-of-unicode/string_to_x.png]

```python
 print(chr(0x1F64F)) # (Unicode character represented by code point U+1F64F)
 üôè
 # Also, chr() creates characters from code points.
 # We could do chr(0xFF) or chr(33)
 print(hex(ord("üôè"))) # -> 0x1f64f
 # ord() is the reverse operation - giving us the base10 codepoint for a specific character
 [ord(i) for i in "hello world"] # -> [104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100]

 # We can represent characters in many analogue ways
 r"""  Escape Sequence    Meaning                                             How To Express "a"
     "\ooo"              Character with octal value ooo                      "\141"
     "\xhh"              Character with hex value hh                         "\x61"
     "\N{name}"          Character named name in the Unicode database        "\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER A}"
     "\uxxxx"            Character with 16-bit (2-byte) hex value xxxx       "\u0061"
     "\Uxxxxxxxx"        Character with 32-bit (4-byte) hex value xxxxxxxx   "\U00000061"
 """
 print(
     "a" ==
     "\x61" ==
     "\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER A}" ==
     "\u0061" ==
     "\U00000061"
     ) # Prints `True` as they are all identical
 # bin, hex and oct are only representations, not a fundamental change in the input.
     >>> import unicodedata
 >>> unicodedata.name("‚Ç¨")
 'EURO SIGN'
 >>> unicodedata.lookup("EURO SIGN")
 '‚Ç¨'
 str(b"\xc2\xbc cup of flour", "utf-8") # -> '¬º cup of flour'
 str(0xc0ffee) # -> '12648430'

 text = "Hello, Unicode! üåç"
 utf8_encoded = text.encode('utf-8')
 print(f"UTF-8 Encoded: {utf8_encoded}")
 utf8_decoded = utf8_encoded.decode('utf-8')
 print(f"Decoded Text: {utf8_decoded}")

 emoji = "ü§®"  # U+1F928
 print(f"Emoji bytes in UTF-8: {emoji.encode('utf-8')}")
```

Encoding text with UTF-8 converts characters into byte representations, which is crucial for I/O operations.

## Final Note on Unicode
Working with Unicode can seem complex, but the main takeaway is this: Unicode standardizes the representation of text across different languages and platforms. Encodings (like UTF-8) implement Unicode by translating its code points into bytes. Each character we see is not just a letter or symbol but a defined code point, encoded into bytes, and then rendered as a glyph.
